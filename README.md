# KaggleEmotions

The project was build using Python 3.11 using jupyter notebook.

The files can be run independently, as long as the data files in the folders are not deleted or modified manually. If one wishes to start the project from the very beginning, the .ipynb files should be run in the correct order indicated by the task number.  

## Tasks
The filenames indicate which task was tackled in which file. In case one file contains more than one task, they contain headings that separate the tasks from each other to enable a proper overview.

The data in the tables of the report can be found in the according task. If the preprocessing shall be skipped, the boolean values for the should_preprocess need to be changed to false.
